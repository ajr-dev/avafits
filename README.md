## Project Overview

This repository contains an unfinished proof-of-concept platform designed for players of the popular game Avakin Life to share their outfits. The primary goal was to create a space where fashion enthusiasts within the game could showcase their creativity, discover new trends, and prepare more effectively for in-game fashion shows.

## Status: Abandoned

**⚠️ This project was abandoned in November 2023 in favor of other projects.**

While the concept showed promise, development has ceased, and the project is no longer maintained.

## Features (Planned)

- User profile creation for Avakin Life players
- Outfit sharing functionality
- Trend analysis and popularity metrics
- Fashion show preparation tools
- Community voting and feedback system

## Why This Project?

Avakin Life is renowned for its focus on fashion and self-expression. This platform aimed to extend that experience beyond the game, allowing players to:

- Gain inspiration from other players' outfits
- Stay updated on current fashion trends within the game
- Improve their chances of success in Avakin Life fashion shows
- Foster a community of fashion-forward players

## Technologies

The project was planned to use the following technology stack:

- Frontend: SvelteKit with Tailwind CSS for responsive and efficient UI development
- Backend: SvelteKit (full-stack framework)
- Database: MongoDB for flexible, document-based data storage
- Build System: Turborepo for optimized build processes and monorepo management
- Hosting/Deployment: Cloudflare for edge computing and content delivery

This stack was chosen for its performance, scalability, and developer-friendly ecosystem.
